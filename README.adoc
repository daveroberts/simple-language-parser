Simple Language Parser
======================
Dave Roberts <dave.a.roberts@gmail.com>

Ruby code which will parse a script file and execute the code inside.

Why
---
To allow scripting in your application without loading code directly and without using `eval`

How to run
----------

[source,console]
----
$ ./run examples/sample.lisp
----

Background
----------
I studied computer scienced in college for six years.  I took a few courses in compilers and languages too.  Despite having great professors, none of it stuck.  This parser was created largely by trial and error.

I'm sure there are much better and more efficient ways to do this.

Lisp files
~~~~~~~~~~
The example files have a .lisp extension so that github and vim syntax highlight the files.  It's not perfect, but it's better than nothing.
